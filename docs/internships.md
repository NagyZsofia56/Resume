### Research camp at the University of Debrecen

I conducted research at the Physics Department during the Summer camp. My projetc was about measuring different types of radiaton, mostly ionizing radiatios. I got to use scintillators, SiPMs and PMTs. On the last day we had to present our work on the student conference, which was a meorable event. It took place in a huge university hall and, every student and helping mentors were there. I truly enjoyed it and learned a lot, not just about radiations and measuring devices but presenting too. There was also an application proccess beforehand, where the applicants had to write an entry abou the chosen research.
