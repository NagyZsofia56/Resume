## Music

I have been the student of György Kroó Music and Arts School for 7 years. My primary instrument is the  Hungarian Folk Flute, that I have been learning for 6 years. My secondary instrument is the Saxophone, that I have been learning for 1 year. I had maximum score on the Hungarian Basics MUsic Exam. I spend 2 hours in the school every week, one hour for each instrument lesson.
