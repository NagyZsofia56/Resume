## Mini-Satellite

![Video](..\images\gif2.gif)

### What is our satellite capable of?
The primary missions were measuring air pressure, acceleration, temperature and sending data to the ground station every second.
Our satellite contains the following: frame, parachute, battery, spectrograph, Arduino Nano Every microcontroller, MPU+BME integrated sensor, buzzer, GPS module, microSD module and microSD, antenna, integrating space+shutter (needed for secondary mission), LoRa telemetry module, voltage converters, wiring respectivly
The main secondary mission focuses on examining the spectral distribution of scattered solar radiation as a function of atmospheric altitude.For that we implented a spectroscope. The spectrograph can only accept diffuse light so I had to creat an integrating space, which was a tackling challenge.

### What were my tasks?
My tasks in the team was penetrating and modelling the structural and mechanical design. For that I used Autodesk Fusiuon 360. My other task was creating and following our outreach programme.

### Outreach programme
Our approach to publicising and communicating the project focuses on leveraging active social media platforms, engaging in targeted outreach activities, and ensuring consistent visibility through various channels.
We maintain an active presence on several social media sites, such as Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Linkedin and Twitter. All of them are accessible via this linktree (LINK). These platforms are regularly updated with project news, ensuring visibility and engagement leading up to key milestones such as the CDR submission date.

### What did I learn during the journey?

I learned to be more tolerant and work better in groups. I also learned a lot of technical skills like 3D modelling, video editing or wiring. I realized I really like working in teams and tackling problems together.


## Shark team

### What is Shark team?

Shark team is a university competion team for the Shell eco marathon. The primary goal is to build an energy efficient car. This year the team is building two, the one that I am too working on is the4 street car.    

### My tasks 

 My primary task was to make the back frame. For this firstly I needed to model the tool, then we could make the actual part. I polished  laminated and learned a lot.

### Valuable lessons I learnt

I gained knowledge in 3D-modelling, specifically surface modelling for which I used Autodesk Fusion 360. Throughout the whole project I worked with several students and excelled in teamwork. Amongst the previously mentioned gains I' ve also grown patiance during the polishing and learned to laminate and work with resin. 

## Projects at Smartiz 

### What is the Smartiz program?

The Smartiz program is an opportunity for ambitious sophomore girls to learn programming and mathematics. This is a year long program, where there are maths and programming lessons every week. The main goal is to make two projects in pairs with the help of two mentors. One  is the career guidence mentor and the other is the technical mentor. Next to the lessons the pairs also have mentroing session regularly to create the projects and to clear their career paths. Another special thing about this program is that there are regular workshops in communication technique, presentation and  team work. The fist conference takes place usually in March, this is time when the student shave to present their programmed games. At the end of the peogram the students have a camp where they present their math projects and can also present the second version of their programming project.

### Programming project

Our projects was a game, which is inspired by the Tower game. We learned to programme in p5.js(process). After we finished the first version, we presented it on a conference for circa 35 people.

### Math project
 
The math project is still ongoing, but it is about chaos. 

## Paper Boomerang 

### How it started and the main goal

 My main goal was to researching the phsysics of paper boomerangs.

### The process and small milestones
The fisrt milestone was when I gave a presentation at Eötvös Loránd University (ELTE). I had already had some results but I decided to work on. My second achievement as to send my final draft to Jakobsleiter journal. Now I made a launcher to minimize the different between the throws.

### Lessons

 During this project I learned to use Premier Pro. I used it to edit the videos of the moving boomerangs. I learned to craft from wood for my launcher. For the article I gained some more experience in writing and finally I got to see how it feels like to conduct research. How to deal with the setbacks and use alternative ideas. 


## Website

The main idea was to make a website for my resume, so that I can upload every achievement to the same place. I would be able to show it the admissions officers and hiring agents too. With the help of my mentor Azouz, I made the website in mkdocs.

### The lessons I learned 

I learned using mkdocs, changing materials, how to use Visual Studio Code.
