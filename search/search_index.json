Another special thing about this program is that there are regular workshops in communication technique, presentation and  team work. The fist conference takes place usually in March, this is time when the student shave to present their programmed games. At the end of the peogram the students have a camp where they present their math projects and can also present the second version of their programming project.</p>"},{"location":"projects/#programming-project","title":"Programming project","text":"<p>Our projects was a game, which is inspired by the Tower game.
